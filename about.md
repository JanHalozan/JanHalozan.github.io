## Who am I?

Hi, I'm Jan.

## Who I really am?

I am batman.

## OK Who I really really am?

I'm a software engineer based in Slovenia. Passionate about artificial intelligence, neural networks, iOS, Swift, design, hardware, computer science in all of its glory and technology in general.

## What do I do?

I make high quality iOS apps. The ones that make people's eyes pop out. And that's no joke. I also hack every now and then and the results range from hardware things (like gimbals, drones, ...) to software... You know what? Just take a look around my page to see what I do.

## Work

I'm currently the lead iOS developer at [Databox](https://databox.com). We're building the best mobile-first business analytics platform on the planet.


## Other interests

I **love** snowboarding. And surfing. And skating. And calisthenics.
