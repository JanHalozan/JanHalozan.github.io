Hi, I'm Jan Halozan.

## Who I really am?

I am batman.

## OK who I really really am?

I'm a software engineer based in Slovenia. Passionate about artificial intelligence, neural networks, iOS, Swift, design, hardware, computer science in all of its glory and technology in general. If you'd like to know more about what I do make sure to check out [Work](/work/) and my [Portfolio](/portfolio/).

## Other interests

I **love** snowboarding. And surfing. And skating. And calisthenics.
