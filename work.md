## Current

Currently I'm the Platforms Lead at [Pollpass](pollpass.com) which is a research divsion at [Global Web Index](globalwebindex.com). At Pollpass we're researching & building a new kind of user panel. My job is further Pollpass by pioneering new platforms that haven't been tapped before based on technical research.

## Previous

Before joining GWI I was the lead iOS engineer at [Databox](databox.com). Databox is a new era business intelligence platform with heavy emphasis on real-time performance tracking and insights. I was in charge of building out the iOS app from scratch and have it running at scale with real-time updates and complex graph hierarchies. Soon after we hired some more mobile developers and I was overseeing a small team of engineers.

## Game Dev

I'm fluent with the Unity game engine and am currently developing a 3D shoot em up tanks game. You can find more progress about it on my Blog.

## iOS development studio

I'm in the process of establishing an independent iOS development studio for high end premium iOS apps. More on that will follow soon.
